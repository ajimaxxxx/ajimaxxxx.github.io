  <h2>About Me 🧠</h2>
  <p>
    My name is <strong>Obari-Ajima Emmanuel Bellor</strong>, widely known as Ajìmã.
    I am a Computer Science student at Bowen University, Iwo.

  <div class="more-text-container">
    <p>
      My journey into technology has not been easy, but it has been meaningful. I have struggled with understanding concepts, restarting from scratch, and questioning my own ability. These struggles shaped my curiosity and strengthened my determination to keep learning. I love exploring new programming languages, solving real-world problems, and creating projects that can make a difference.

  <h2>Why Computer Science? 💻</h2>
  <p>
    Computer Science represents problem-solving, creativity, and logic.
  </p>
  <div class="more-text-container">
    <p>
      It allows me to build ideas from nothing and transform thoughts into functional systems. I believe technology is one of the strongest tools for shaping the future. Through continuous learning, mistakes, and practice, I aim to improve my skills and understanding of how software impacts real life. I also enjoy collaborating with other developers and contributing to open-source projects whenever possible.
